        Use <b>Delete Account</b> link from the swipe menu to go to Delete account screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        This screen has only one button, <b>Delete My Account</b> which, on clicking, remove your registration and other location details from the servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will also remove any data that application has stored on you device locally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you delete your account, you won't be able to recover any information.
